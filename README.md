Go-Vec README
====================

Go-Vec is a work in progress.

Objectives
------------

* Make a Go library for higher math and science (a la GSL / numpy / scipy), written in Go
* Take advantage of Go's concurrency primitives to deliver high-performance subroutines
* Take advantage of Interfaces to make this library easy and intuitive to extend

Contributing
-------------

* Make sure your code passes testing.
* We need more tests. Please write some.
* If you add functionality, write tests for it.
